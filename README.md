# ML_Metastatic_Prediction-
Machine Learning Characterization of a Novel Panel for Metastatic Prediction in Breast Cancer

##Background
Metastasis is one of the most challenging problems in cancer diagnosis and
treatment, as its causes have not been yet well characterized. Prediction of
the metastatic status of breast cancer is important in cancer research because
it has the potential to save lives. However, the systems biology behind
metastasis is complex and driven by a variety of factors beyond those that
have already been characterized for various cancer types. Furthermore,
prediction of cancer metastasis is a challenging task due to the variation in
parameters and conditions specific to individual patients and mutation of the
sub-types.

## Results
we apply tree-based machine learning algorithms for gene
expression data analysis in the estimation of metastatic potentials within a
group of 490 breast cancer patients. Hence, we utilize tree-based machine
learning algorithms, decision trees, gradient boosting, and extremely
randomized trees to assess the variable importance.
